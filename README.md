The source of my homemade code for the GY21 sensors.
The whole setup fits in a small black box.

The aims are:

- (done) write a code for a homeserver with a working Wifi connection and OTA settings 
- (done) a working MQTT broker
- (done) creating a Home Assistant environment
- creating aTelegram Bot for critical values
